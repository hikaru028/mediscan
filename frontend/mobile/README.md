3. Go to your Ngrok dashboard and get your authtoken
3. Add authtoken (E.g., $ ngrok config add-authtoken <token>)
4. run backend server with `flask run --host=0.0.0.0`
5. in another console window, go the same directory as the backend(virtual environment)
5. run ngrok server with `ngrok http http://localhost:5000`
6. In your ngrok console, copy your URL (E.g., `https://0000-000-000-00-000.ngrok-free.app`)
7. Go to `app/ngrok.ts`
8. Replace URL with your URL copied previously

## Get started
1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
