It tones up and rejuvenates the skin, activates metabolism, stimulates blood circulation, and provides intense moisturizing to the skin.

Malhotra J, et al. World J Anemia 2017;1(4):1-6. Liposomal Iron with patented LIPOSHELL technology FERRO LIPO-SACHETS Iron is an essential element, present in all cells in the human body, and has several vital functions. It contributes to the production of energy and is necessary for the normal formation of red blood cells and haemoglobin which carry oxygen to body tissues from the lungs. Iron contributes to normal cognitive function and to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. Ferro Lipo-Sachets is intended for adults with an increased demand for iron, such as in pregt women, women in the perimenstrual period, in blood donors, vegetarians and vegans. Ferro Lipo-Sachets contains liposomal iron enclosed in the patented LIPOSHELL formula. The LIPOSHELL technology helps ensure the iron is protected from substances within the body's digestive system which may degrade the active ingredient and reduce absorption. Enclosing iron in the LIPOSHELL liposomes allows effective transport of iron to locations in the body where it is required, resulting in a high absorption rate, and helps to reduce stomach upset, constipation, an unpleasant metallic taste and other side effects that may be experienced with iron supplements. Ferro Lipo-Sachets may assist you if you are: Feeling tired Lacking in energy Looking to maintain healthy iron levels. Available in Strawberry flavour. No artificial colours, flavours or thickeners.
